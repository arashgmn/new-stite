Hi!

Thanks for checking out my webpage. I'm *Arash* and I write about stuff that concern or intimidate me on some way -- like every one else. But, you may ask why blogging and not, for instance, using social platforms. Well, there are a few reasons:

- **Referencing**: Social media are often not that searchable,
- **Austhetic and integrity**: they come with limitation (character limits, media size and formats, etc.),
- **Calmness**: there's fight for getting attention out there which is harmful for the type of exchange I wish to have, 
- **Development**: I want to work on my writing skills. I don't like it, but it organizes my thoughts, which is comforting.

The fact that I write about things doesn't mean I know tons about them.

Like most of you, I also care about different forms of social segregations. I try to share my point of view and have it challenged here (through your comments :) ). I studied mechanical engineering, physics, and computational science, and this academic training has heavily shaped my view and my way of thinking. Look at my [detailed CV]() or [projects]() if that matters to you. I also follow art in form of music, movies, and novels.
