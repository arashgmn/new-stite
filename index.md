I am Arash and this is a my personal website.

At the moment I use here for journaling mainly (in the [blog](/blog.html) section). Time to time, I may dump some modeling/coding in the [simulations](/simulations.html) section if I feel there's a problem that interests me.


There's also an [archive](/archive.html), which might be useful in future, for searching among all my posts based on their tag.

**Important note about commenting**
1. Comments are very welcome, but only for the simulations and not my journals! 
2. The commenting system I'm using is a bit weird. It requires you to log in. I've seen this platform being used almost everywhere, so I started to use it, but honestly, I haven't worked with it much either. Anyway, it wouldn't be a big problem as of now, since I don't have many simulations yet. 
3. If you need the urge to comment (I genuinely appreciate it, if that is the case) don't worry. You can always check the last tickbox (*I'd rather post as a guest*), and skip signing up. For a more anonymous comment, just use a fake email like `fake@email.com`.
