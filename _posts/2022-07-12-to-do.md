The site looks nice, but there are a few things to be fixed.

# Small things
1. **home**: I need a header image like other pages. Don't know yet how to modify it on the remote-theme-based site.
2. **author profile**: Do I really need to show it on every page? Doesn't it make more sense to incude it only on the *About*?
3. **Sitemap**: The logo of the site map doesn't work. I tried three reasonable combinations:
    - `fab fa-fw fa-sitemap`
    - `fab fa-regular fa-sitemap`
    - `fa-regular fa-sitemap` (this is what font awesome gives)
    
# Middle range things
1. **Comments** are not displayed. Some say I have to somehow set `JEKYLL_ENV=production`, either by making a `gh_page` branch, or something local. Interestingly though, [the docu itself](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout/uncategorized/layout-comments/), has no comments where it should have.

# Huge things
It sucks to push everything on github a wait to see the results. I defenitely want to set things up locally. But it simply doesn't work with github-pages. Should I make a `gh-page` branch or something? 

**Note**: Maybe this effects the commets issues.
