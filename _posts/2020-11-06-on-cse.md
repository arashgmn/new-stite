How to explain CSE to your grandmother.
<!--more-->

There are things that are hard to descrie and has to be experienced, like the MSc. program I participated in: [Computational Science & Engineering](). In this review my attempt is to disentangle it a bit. In short: the key is *Computational*; Out there you hear a lot computational biology/physics/mathematics/mechanics/neuroscience/finance/astrophysics/... . Are these what is thought in this program? Well, in my perspective yes and no. Here is my narrative.

# Why no?
Study of any science or engineering field is roughly equivalent to building up formal frameworks for expressing specific type of problems. There is a founadtion to every framework and some main branches. Initially, branches were independent. But as the field grows, they grow root and strenght, and interact eith each other by giving and taking. The bridges may




--- comments:
1. connect the depths of each majors with the branch development and the interaction of fields
2. figure out how to bring the computational problem types for reader
3. In why yes: justsay that it covers things...
4. compile them in intro
5. break it down to two categories
6. bring reading difficulties
7. bring the benefits (if any)
